scitos_2d_navigation
====================

The scitos_navigation stack provides tools for building both 2D and  3D maps, and for using these maps for navigation and visualisation.

## 2D Mapping and Navigation

## 3D Mapping and Navigation 

At the moment this contains code and information for running the navigation stack together with the octomap 3d mapping tool. For information on octomap, have a look at: http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~hornunga/pub/hornung13auro.pdf

For instructions on how to get the dependencies and run octomap, have a look at: https://github.com/strands-project/scitos_3d_mapping_and_navigation/wiki/Get-up-and-running
